            There are four characteristic clicks in the language, and they are represented by the letters: “│” “║” “!” “╪”.
            
            The Dental click “│”
            The “│” click sound is made by breaking a slight suction that is created by just placing the very tip of the tongue behind the upper front teeth; where they meet the gums; then (keeping both lips slightly apart) draw the tip of the tongue away from the teeth.
        
            The Palatal click “!”
            The “!” click sound is made by breaking a slight suction, made with the forward portion of the tongue against the roof of the mouth (palate), where it curves downwards towards the upper front teeth. In breaking this suction, a sharp downward movement of the tongue is made, whilst the lips are slightly apart. In producing this sound a sharp downward movement of the lower jaw is also noticeable.
        
            The Lateral click “║”
            The “║” click sound is made by breaking a suction created between either side of the tongue and relative cheek. In making this sound, the lips and teeth are kept slightly apart and the lower jaw is not moved upwards or downwards.
            
            The Alveolar click “╪”
            The “╪” click sound is made by breaking a suction, that is created by placing the tip of the tongue between the front teeth and pulling back the tongue with both lips slightly apart.
